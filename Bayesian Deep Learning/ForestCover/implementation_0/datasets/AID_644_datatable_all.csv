RESULT_DESCR,,,,,,,Activity Qualifier identifies if the resultant data IC50 came from a fitted curve or was determined manually to be less than or greater than its listed IC50 concentration,Qualified IC50 in molar: The concentration at which 50% of the inhibition is observed (relative to 100% inhibition of 13 micromolar reference inhibitor),Log10 of the qualified IC50 in M concentration.,"The variable HillSlope describes the steepness of the curve. This variable is called the Hill slope, the slope factor, or the Hill coefficient. If it is positive, the curve increases as X increases. If it is negative, the curve decreases as X increases. A standard sigmoid dose-response curve (previous equation) has a Hill Slope of 1.0. When HillSlope is less than 1.0, the curve is more shallow. When HillSlope is greater than 1.0, the curve is steeper. The Hill slope has no units.",Y-min of the curve.,Y-max of the curve.,The range of Y.,"A measure for the 'goodness' of a fit. The chi-square test (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989) is used to test if a sample of data came from a population with a specific distribution.",This value indicates how successful the fit explains the variation of the data; R-square is the square of the correlation between the response values and the predicted response values.,Number of excluded point in the dose-response curve (counting one data point per concentration).,Overall number of data points of normalized percent inhibition that was used for calculations (includes all concentration points); in some cases a data point can be excluded as an outlier.,Normalized percent inhibition at 3.0 nanomolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 9.1 nanomolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 27.3 nanomolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 81.8 nanomolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 245.4 nanomolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 0.7 micromolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 2.2 micromolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 6.6 micromolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 19.9 micromolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.,Normalized percent inhibition at 59.6 micromolar inhibitor concentration; average of triplicate measurement.
